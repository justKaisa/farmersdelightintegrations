### Recipes
Your mod must have a folder with the name of its modID in src/main/resources/data. Ideally have distinct folders for cutting and cooking. Use the JSON recipe files from other mod folders as templates. 

Of course, always make use of tags rather than items when it's possible. There's plenty of vanilla Minecraft and Forge tags you can use. Also, use your intuition. Don't, like, put water buckets in your recipes.
